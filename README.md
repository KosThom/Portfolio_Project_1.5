# Portfolio_Project_5
Movie Data Exploration using Python. 

In this project we will use Python in order to draw some simple conlcusions from a csv movie dataset (time period 1986-2016).

At first we check the data for missing values and duplicates. 

We do some grouping and slicing of the data in order to see
  1. the top-10 movies by gross revenue (1986-2016)
  2. the top-10 companies by gross revenue (1986-2016)
      - Using the data from 2. we create a horizontal bar chart
  3. the total gross revenue by year (1986-2016)
      - Using the data from 3. we create a line chart 

We check the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between the budget and the gross revenue, so we create a scatterplot (budget vs gross revenue) and then we add a regression line. 

We also check if there is a correlation between budget and score from the viewers, therefore we create the 
respective scatterplot with regression line

We have also built a correlation matrix and the respective heatmap in order to calculate the correlation coefficients (budget vs gross revenue and budget vs score, respectively).
